## Project Description
This project is an OpenGL GLUT C++ program that allows users to create and fill shapes by clicking on a window. This project was made for an assignment for my Computer Graphics Algorithm Class 

## Features
- Draw shapes by clicking points on the window
- Fill shapes with white color
- Right-click to complete the shape
- Uses a black background for better visibility

## How to Run
1. Compile the C++ code using a suitable C++ compiler that supports OpenGL and GLUT.
2. Run the compiled executable.

## Usage
- Left-click to place points on the window for the shape.
- Right-click to complete the shape, which will fill it with white color.

## Future Improvements
1. Add the ability to choose different colors for shapes.
2. Implement a user interface for easier interaction.
3. Improve the efficiency of the drawing algorithm.
